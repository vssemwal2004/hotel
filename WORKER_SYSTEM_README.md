## 🧪 Testing

### Test Admin User Creation:
```javascript
POST http://localhost:5000/api/users
{
  "name": "Test Worker",
  "email": "testworker@hotel.com",
  "password": "worker123",
  "role": "worker",
  "department": "Reception"
}
```

### Test Worker Login:
1. Go to `/auth/login`
2. Email: testworker@hotel.com
3. Password: worker123
4. Should redirect to `/worker`

### Test Access Control:
- Worker tries to access `/admin` → Redirected to `/home`
