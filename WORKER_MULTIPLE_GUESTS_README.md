```

   ```javascript
   const removeGuest = (index) => {

   }
   ```

3. **Update Guest Field**
   ```javascript
   const updateGuest = (index, field, value) => {
     const updated = [...guests]
     updated[index] = { ...updated[index], [field]: value }
     setGuests(updated)
   }
   ```

4. **Guest Cards UI**
   - Each guest in its own card
   - Delete button (red trash icon) - only if more than 1 guest
   - Primary guest marked with green tag

  .filter(g => g.name.trim()) // Only guests with names
  .map(g => ({
    name: g.name.trim(),
    email: g.email.trim() || undefined,
    phone: g.phone.trim() || undefined,
    age: Number(g.age) || 21,
    type: g.type
  }))

// Use primary guest for user record
const primaryGuest = guests.find(g => g.name.trim()) || guests[0]

const payload = {
  user: { 
    name: primaryGuest.name.trim(), 
    email: primaryGuest.email.trim() || `guest${Date.now()}@hotel.com` 
  },
  checkIn,
  fullDay,
  ...(fullDay ? {} : { checkOut }),
  items: [ {

    quantity: Number(quantity), 
    guests: guestList      // ✅ All guests with details
