## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Not authenticated" error

3. Clear browser cookies and localStorage
4. Login again

**Code to run in browser console:**
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
document.cookie.split(";").forEach(c => {
  document.cookie = c.trim().split("=")[0] + "=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC;path=/";
});
location.reload()
```

### Issue: "Room types not loading"

**Solution:**
1. Check if room types exist in database
2. Create room types in admin panel first
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Navigation redirects to login

**Solution:**
1. Verify user role is "worker" or "admin"
2. Check backend logs for authentication errors
3. Verify JWT token is valid

### Issue: Can't access worker pages

**Checklist:**
- âœ… Is backend running?
- âœ… Is MongoDB connected?
- âœ… Is user logged in with worker role?
- âœ… Is frontend running?
- âœ… Are there any console errors?
